# Sleep Disorder Detection with Bayesian Machine Learning
### With `Bayes_SleepDisorder.ipynb` and `sleep.csv` dataset, the file can be run in .jupyter notebooks or Google Colab. The goals for this project are focusing on:

### 1. Describe the uncertainty in a sleep disorder diagnosis given lifestyle and sleep quality measurements
### 2. Evaluate the posterior probability distributions of the regression parameters for the predictor variables from above (lifestyle/sleep predictors)
### 3. Evaluate the model predictions and the uncertainties in these predictions.
